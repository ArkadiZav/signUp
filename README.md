# signUp
 Added sfunctionality to the sign-up form.
 The "Sign up" button is working and doing some basic input validation. 
 The validation is as follows: 
 
  *The username must be over 5 characters
  *The password must be at least 6 characters long. 
  *Both passwords must be the same. 
  *Country must be either Israel or USA. 
  *The phone number must be shorter than 15 digits.
  
  
If there is more than one error, I list all of them.
The error messages are displayed in a red font.

If there are no errors, I display a personal greeting message in a green font.
